# Recommender-System Question:


You are provided the browsing behavior of website users looking at hotels within a city. You know which continent each user is from, each user’s gender, and the star rating of each hotel in the city. The identifiers of users, hotels, and continents have been anonymized for privacy reasons.
Predict for each user what one hotel in the city they looked at next. Your predictions should be in a tab- delimited file with a column for user and a column for hotel.
Justify your choice of approach to the problem and why you chose it over other possible approaches. Provide your interpretation of the problem and the dataset.
In addition to your predictions please include the code you used to produce them. Code should work in an open source environment. Include any details required to make it run.
Included files:
• activity.txt – what hotels each user looked at
• users.txt – users, home continents, and gender
• hotels.txt – all hotels and their star ratings
